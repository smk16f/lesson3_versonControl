            <p class="lead">As a future developer, you may have already had data related issues. During the 
            development process, once a product has been pushed out into the real world, it must still be
            updated from time to time. Version control systems help developers manage and control the files 
            that make up their project using VCS’s like github or bitbucket. These systems keep track of all
            the file states, from current and previous versions, compare changes over time, see who modifies
            the project files, issue tracking features, and makes version recovery much easier for projects 
            that get messed up.</p>

            <p class="lead">Github started its life as a file sharing system for the Linux kernel. The Linux 
            kernel was originally passed around using patches and archive files. To make Linux development 
            easier to access, the community started storing updates in a then free to use digital repository 
            known as BitKeeper. Once the free to us software decided to charge for its services, the open 
            source community, begin open source…. Decided to develop a platform that was fast, easy to use 
            had strong support for linear branches of development, was fully distributed, and was capable of
            handling large projects. Since its creation in 2005, Github has continued to strive to not only
            meet all these requirements but to also exceed all expectations. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The basics of Github start around the logic behind the Github system. Unlike other
            version control systems, the files stored in Github are not looked at like other traditional content
            management systems. Instead of saving the file tree and all the different changes made to the files,
            Github takes a snapshot of the file tree and only saves changes to files that have been modified. If 
            the file has not been modified, a link to the last saved state is included in the current master 
            branch. Not only does Github save files differently, most processes are performed on local machines
            speeding things up significantly. </p>

            <p class="lead">The backbone of the Github system is the repository. This is the digital structure
            that will house all the future files and projects that you deposit onto your Github account. To get
            started, you will need to access your computers command line in order to effectively access the Git 
            commands. If this environment is foreign to you, take some time to read up on your operating systems
            command line do’s and don’ts. Once you have familiarized yourself with some command line calisthenics, 
            it’s time to type in your first command. The git init command starts a repository with that skeleton
            I was referring to earlier. This repository will be the place that all your files will save to when 
            they are on your local machine, and where they will be pushed to the Git repository of your choice 
            later. </p>

            <p class="lead">So you’ve decided after reading that you like the sounds of having your own Github account?
            Well here’s some more good news, they’re very easy to set up! Step one is to go to https://github.com. 
            From there, pick your own username, enter an email address, and create a strong password. From there,
            you will be asked to choose your plan. If you are not developing a super-secret project, then the free
            account will suit you just fine. However, if you have any projects that you would like to be kept out 
            of the publics eye, going with one of the other plans will be a must for you. After you’ve made you 
            selections, it’s time to start playing around with the dashboard for Github. Take the time to play with
            the tutorials and absorb as much information as you can.  </p>
